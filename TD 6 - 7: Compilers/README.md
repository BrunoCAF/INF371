# Compilers

This project was a first experiment with the design of a compiler. The language to be compiled was a limited part of Java, equipped with basic if-else and loop structures, in addition to standard variables and expressions management. 

The target machine language was the XVM, a simplified version of the JVM, developed by the Computer Science departement at Ã‰cole Polytechnique.
