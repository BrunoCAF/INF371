# Madame Bovary's 36th Chapter

This project dealt with Stochastic Text Generation, based on Markov Chains, in order to produce a ficticious 36th chapter for the book "Madame Bovary", based on the word frequencies from the 35 original chapters, and the order of their appearance. 

The algorithm employed linked lists and hash tables to build association tables, which would later be used to randomly generate sentences and paragraphs for the new chapter.
