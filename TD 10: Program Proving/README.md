# Automatic Program Proving

This project was a first contact with automatic program provers, which are tools intended for assuring that a program produces the correct, desired outputs, given the inputs. 

In this case the chosen program prover was Why3, whose online version can be accessed [here](http://why3.lri.fr/try/)
